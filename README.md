![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

The README generator is a node powered application that allows a user to build a README template simply through answering prompts in the terminal. The application utilizes Inquirer's prompt system to generate and save user responses. These responses are then added dynamically to a markdownGenreator function that is refreshed each time the Inquirer is run in the terminal.
